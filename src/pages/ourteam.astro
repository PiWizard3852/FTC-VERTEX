              Eli is currently a junior at Phillips Exeter Academy. She grew up
              in Shanghai, but now lives in New Jersey with her parents and
              older sister. She first developed an interest in robotics during
              her freshman year in Shanghai, but she was unable to attend any
              competitions due to Covid. She is very excited to learn more about
