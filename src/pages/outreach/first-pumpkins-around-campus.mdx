This fall, in honor of the spooky season, our team hosted a **campus-wide FIRST pumpkin scavenger hunt** to spread knowledge of FIRST and bring gracious fun to Exeter!

Lasercut pumpkin design!

As a team, we designed and laser-cut pumpkins with information about our team and the FIRST mission. We relayed this information to the student body and hosted a successful scavenger hunt! When pumpkins were returned, students earned a fall treat.

We planned this scavenger hunt over a week and were glad to spread fun and knowledge about FIRST to our community! In total, **over 100 community members** interacted with the scavenger hunt!
