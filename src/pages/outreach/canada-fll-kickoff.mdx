We were invited to speak at the Canada First Lego League Kickoff! Our goal was to inspire younger students to pursue FIRST robotics and teach students about some of the other components that go into a robotics competition. We walked younger teams through the process of how to make a stand-out presentation, offering tips and tricks that we’ve picked up along our years of experience. Our presentation included how to plan content and visuals for a presentation, how to prepare, tips for practicing your presentation, and presentation methods such as what your body language, tone, pace, and volume can express while presenting. Presentations are one aspect of robotics where you get to directly engage with other people and convey all that you’ve learned, so they should be both fun and an imperative skill to learn from robotics! We wished to create a fun and engaging presentation to help students hone this skill in robotics and beyond!
