@ftc_nh: Team 15534 VERTEX from Exeter NH wins the Inspire award! This is their rookie year, and theyâ€™ll be moving on to the world championship!

We were honored to have received the INSPIRE Award at the New Hampshire State Championships! As a rookie team, this came as a surprise, especially because of our time constraint at Exeter. In addition to winning Inspire, we also won the Promote Award(https://vimeo.com/314414344), and were Finalists for the Control, Motivate, Connect, and Think Awards. Our robot, dubbed "Riboflavin Central", achieved a ranking of Third Overall with no losses. Although an alliance captain, we were paired against Gluten Free(#11115) in SemiFinals, thus failed to advance to the Final Rounds.

We are excited to meet all the other teams at the World Championship in Detroit! Congratulations to team Gluten Free for being the Winning Alliance Captain and the other NH team going to Worlds!

The work doesn't stop here, though. Vincent, our Mechanical Captain, has visions of creating a much faster robot, while Penny, Programming Lead, is aiming for the Control Award at Worlds. Our Community Outreach Team, led by Summer, is working really hard to plan some more fun C.O. activities for the months to come.
