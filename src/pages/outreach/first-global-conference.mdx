Halfway through summer, Vincent was invited to serve as a panelist during the FIRST Global Conference. Members of this conference were able to learn more about our team’s FIRST experience through this question and answer session, moderated by Ms. Nancy Boyer. Vincent was also able to socialize with the other team representatives, and formed new connections for this year’s season.
