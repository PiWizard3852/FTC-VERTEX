For the first time ever, we are hosting a virtual VERTEX Tech Speaker Series: a series of virtual tech talks for middle and high schoolers globally! We'll be inviting STEM professionals to speak all throughout the 2021-2022 season. The purpose of this series is twofold: to give interested students access to learning about cutting-edge technology from professionals in the field and to create the future talent pipeline for robotics. Potential topics include mechanical engineering at NASA, engineering within FIRST, and the path to a career in STEM.

If you are interested in speaking or helping out, contact us at [info@ftcvertex.com](mailto:info@ftcvertex.com)!
